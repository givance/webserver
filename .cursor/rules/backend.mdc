# Backend Guidelines
- Avoid using any, always use strict types.
- Use async / await consistently, no callbacks.
- Use log as needed, follow logging best practices. Format the log message yourself, do not rely on logging library to format it. Avoid using logger.log('text', object), always format in line.
